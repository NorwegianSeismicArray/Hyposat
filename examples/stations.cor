*
* This is a file containing values to calculate corrections
* for the listed stations only
*
* All lines starting with a star '*' are ignored.
*
* Minimum input:
*
* Station name and local P and S velocities to calculate
* elevation effect
*
* Vp or Vs given in this file for a specific station always
* overrides values given by the parameters
* P-VELOCITY TO CORRECT ELEVATION and 
* S-VELOCITY TO CORRECT ELEVATION or defined by CRUST 1.0
*
*      vp  vs
*GERES 5.2 3.2
*
* Optional input (e.g., to correct for results from
* tomographic studies or clock errors) od static time shifts.
* No corrections are applied to IS or T phase onsets:
*
* Static corrections for P and S body waves, including Lg. The
* corrections are added (!) to the observed travel times:
*
*      vp  vs  dtp dts
*GERES 5.2 3.2 0.0 0.0
*
* Additonal static time corrections for surface-wave type
* onsets (Rg, LQ, LR, L ). The corrections are added (!) to
* the observed travel times:
*
*      vp  vs dtp dts dtsurface
