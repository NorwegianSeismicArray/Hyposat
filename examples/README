This directory contains examples of input and output 
files for the location program HYPOSAT version 6.2 .

Copy one type of input files (named with a common
extension .single_array, .net, .regional, or .tele) 
to hyposat-in and hyposat-parameter. 

Run hyposat and compare the hyposat-out file with 
the corresponding pre-calculated output file.

On Linux you can just run the attached script 
'run xxx' with 
xxx = single_array, net, regional, or tele

E.g., 'run tele'

To run the example for HYPOMOD just run the script 
'run_hypomod_example'.
