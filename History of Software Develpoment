# Major improvements, corrections or changes since summer 1996:

12-15 February 1997
      czo = b  means: starting with 'f' and ending with 'd'
      Flow of calculations for oscillating solutions changed, especially for depth determinations.
      Correcting to-time for Wadati formula; included some maximum values for to.
      Handling of dtm changed.
      P1 and S1 included as phase name for (unknown) first P- and S-onsets. The program choose the right name depending on travel-time table and distance.

13 March 1997
      Usage of PKiKP instead of PKPdf whenever PKPdf does not exist (for observations around the triplication). Similar changes for P/Pdif and S/Sdif.
      Startsolution always at the closest station, if no backazimuth information is available.

23 April 1997
      Some changes in hyposat_gmi to print out the resolution, covariance, correlation, and the information-density matrix.

Version 2.2 May 8, 1997
      Station corrections included with file station.cor.
      Small bug to calculate dpdh removed.

Version 3.0 June 2, 1997
      Local velocity model included.
      Checking if oscillating solution is running over 4 solutions.
